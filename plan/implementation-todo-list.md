## Notes

- This list is comprehensive but can be adapted based on time constraints
- Phases 1-8 (Backend) and 9-12 (Frontend) are critical path items
- Testing (Phases 8, 14) can be done incrementally alongside development
- Documentation (Phase 15) should be updated continuously
- Each checkbox represents a concrete, testable deliverable
- Focus on getting core functionality working first, then polish
- Use feature branches and PRs for organized development (optional)
